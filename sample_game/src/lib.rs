// This file is intentionally left mostly empty.
// The game logic has been temporarily integrated into the `miyabi_logic` crate
// to facilitate the implementation of the game state machine.
// In the future, this `sample_game` crate will serve as a proper example
// of how to use the MIYABI engine SDK, with a clear separation of concerns.

// We can still use the logic crate if needed, for example, to define a
// custom main entry point if the engine supports it later.
